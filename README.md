## About:
A simple API for the top foodtruck in each US state. 

## How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js. 

## Future Optimizations:

Add more foodtrucks for each state.

## Lessons Learned:

This API project has reiterated the importance of double-checking that the data users are requesting is up-to-date. I also learned to
re-read the code, check for syntax errors, and test the API multiple times throughout the project to confirm that it's functioning correctly.
