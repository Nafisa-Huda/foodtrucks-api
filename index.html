        <h4>How to access individual foodtrucks according to state:</h4>
        <p>For the direct link to the individual object (JSON): https://foodtruck-by-state-api.herokuapp.com/states/stateName</p>
        <p>For the JS formatted fetch parameter: `https://foodtruck-by-state-api.herokuapp.com/states/${stateName}`</p>
        <p>The direct link to the individual stateName object will only need the "stateName" query parameter changed to the specific state being requested.
           The stateName query parameter can be substituted by any of the US states. It is spelling specific with spaces separating each word and is NOT case-sensitive.</p>
        <p>There are 2 keys that come with each US state. One being the name of the foodtruck and the second being the cuisine of the food.<p>
